# Installation

Installing the lightSlider plugin can be done in one of two ways. Our GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the plugin with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file.

## GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this plugin is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's Terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install lightslider

This will install the lightSlider plugin into your `/user/plugins` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/lightslider`.

## Manual Installation

To install this plugin, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then, rename the folder to `lightslider`. You can find these files either on [GitHub](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-lightslider) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins#extras).

You should now have all the plugin files under

	/your/site/grav/user/plugins/lightslider

> NOTE: This plugin is a modular component for Grav which requires [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav), the [Error](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-error) and [Problems](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-problems) plugins, and a theme to be installed in order to operate.

# Usage

To best understand how lightSlider works, you should read through the original project [documentation](http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightslider/settings.html).

This plugin is provided as a [modular page](http://learn.getgrav.org/content/content-pages#modular-page) within Grav. That modular page created should be called `lightslider.md` so that it will automatically use the lightslider twig template already provided in the plugin.

The plugin has **three** primary modes. Those are **text**, **caption** and **image** mode.

## Text Mode

In this mode you can create content for each slider. Each section of slide content is defined as a single Grav page, but you divide the slides up using the markdown `---` syntax to signify a _thematic break_.

When in text mode, the lightslider template automatically looks for images of the format: `image-1.jpg`, `image-2.jpg`, `image-3.jpg`, etc. It will associate each section of the page content to each image in order.

The whole image darkens and the text will be in front of it.

## Caption Mode

Works like text mode, but looks like this:

## Image Mode

In image mode, every file in the folder of the page will be picked up and used for the slider in **file-order**, usually alphabetical.  In other words, if you wish a specfic order, prefix your filenames with a numeric value. For example: `01.ducks.jpg`, `02.fish.jpg`, etc.

## Options

The default `lightslider.yaml` file looks like this:

```
enabled: true
built_in_css: true
slider_type: text
type_text_height: auto
type_text_vertical_padding: 80px
type_text_horizontal_padding: 50px
type_text_brightness: 0
item: 1
slideMove: 1
slideMargin: 0
centerSlide: 'false'
loop: 'false'
mode: 'fade'
controls: 'true'
keyPress: 'true'
auto: 'false'
pause: 2000
speed: 1000
pager: 'true'
gallery: 'false'
gallery_thumb_width: 100
gallery_thumb_height: 100
gallery_margin: 15
gallery_thumb_margin: 5
enableTouch: 'true'
enableDrag: 'true'
pauseOnHover: 'false'
```

You can copy this file and override any defaults you wish in a file called `user/config/plugins/lightslider.yaml`.  However, the preferred approach is to set lightslider options directly in the header of your `lightslider.md` page file that should sit in the same directory as your images.  For example you could have a page such as:

```
---
title: Slider Content
routable: false
visible: false
lightslider:
    slider_type: text
    type_text_vertical_padding: 70px;
    type_text_horizontal_padding: 50px;
    type_text_brightness: -100
    mode: slide
    pager: 'true'
    controls: 'true'
    keyPress: 'true'
    pause: 2000
    speed: 1000
---

You can find more variables, as well as information on how to use them on the the original lightSlider project [documentation](http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightslider/settings.html).

This page also contains three sections defined by the `___` separator. Each section will be associated with an image provided alongside this `lightslider.md` file.  For example the first section will be displayed on top of `image-1.jpg` image file.

## Injecting lightSlider into a non-modular Page

Just because lightSlider is designed to run on a modular page, doesn't mean it has to be.

In our [Shop Site Skeleton](http://github.com/getgrav/grav-skeleton-shop-site/archive/master.zip), we faked a modular page by adding a string that tells Grav to find our lightSlider page and load it as `page` to the included `modular/lightslider.html.twig` template.

Here is the string we used in the `snipcart.html.twig` file which acts as the template file for the front page of the Shop Site Skeleton.

    {% include 'modular/lightslider.html.twig' with {'page': page.find('/slider')} %}

Our lightSlider page, which was located in `/your/site/grav/user/pages/slider`, was set up as any other modular lightSlider page.

# Updating

As development for lightSlider continues, new versions may become available that add additional features and functionality, improve compatibility with newer Grav releases, and generally provide a better user experience. Updating lightSlider is easy, and can be done through Grav's GPM system, as well as manually.

## GPM Update (Preferred)

The simplest way to update this plugin is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm). You can do this with this by navigating to the root directory of your Grav install using your system's Terminal (also called command line) and typing the following:

    bin/gpm update lightslider

This command will check your Grav install to see if your lightSlider plugin is due for an update. If a newer release is found, you will be asked whether or not you wish to update. To continue, type `y` and hit enter. The plugin will automatically update and clear Grav's cache.

## Manual Update

Manually updating lightSlider is pretty simple. Here is what you will need to do to get this done:

* Delete the `your/site/user/plugins/lightslider` directory.
* Downalod the new version of the lightSlider plugin from either [GitHub](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-lightslider) or [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins#extras).
* Unzip the zip file in `your/site/user/plugins` and rename the resulting folder to `lightslider`.
* Clear the Grav cache. The simplest way to do this is by going to the root Grav directory in terminal and typing `bin/grav clear-cache`.

> Note: Any changes you have made to any of the files listed under this directory will also be removed and replaced by the new set. Any files located elsewhere (for example a YAML settings file placed in `user/config/plugins`) will remain intact.
